Use with caution could have errors/vulnerabilities.\r\n - Daemonizar: make your program a daemon.\r\n - Lib semaforos: manage your semaphores easily.\r\n - Linked list: elems can be whatever struct you want.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### www.github.com/manurs/neuron-models\r\nDiferent libs to work with neuron models, hybrid circuits and closed-loop technologies.\r\nCOMEDI, RTAI.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### www.github.com/manurs/neurogenetico\r\nJava Machine Learning platform (neural networks, genetic algorithms, kmeans, knn)\r\n\r\n### www.github.com/manurs/compiler\r\nA little compiler.\r\n\r\nCan be useful to learn how compilers works.\r\n\r\nIncluding:\r\n - Symbol table: just global and local zones.\r\n - Hash: used by symbol table. Can be adapted changing the struct and functions (is not struct independet, by this is not including in libs). \r\n - Lexical analyzer.\r\n - Parser.\r\n - Code generation.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### www.github.com/manurs/search_algorithms\r\nSearch algorithms.\r\n\r\nAlso are include tools to generate the dictionaries, measure the times or plot the results.\r\n\r\n***\r\n",
